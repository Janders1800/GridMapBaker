# GridMapBaker
A Godot script that bakes a GridMap into a MeshInstance.

GridMap has a lot of visual limitations. So I've written a script that bakes the GridMap into a MeshInstance. This way you can take all the advantages of a GeometryInstance, like visual layers, Material overrides, etc.

_**NOTE:** This script has been written for 3.X, but it should be fairly easy to convert to 4.X_
